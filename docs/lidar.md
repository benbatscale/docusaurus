## Moving Objects
1. Find the frame with the densest points for moving object and refine.
2. Delete different keyframes to allow for interpolation.
3. Stabilize z-index and find correctness/consistency all throughout the frames.
4. Make sure Directional Heading is correct.
5. Go through each frame and each view (overhead, top, back) and make sure it is consistent all throughout
